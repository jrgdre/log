# Log

Goal of the project is to have a unified Pascal interface for program log 
messages.

## Build

Should be easy to compile from any Pascal environment.
Developed using FPC and Visual Studio Code with the OmniPascal extension.

Debugger under MS-Windows is msys64\\mingw64\\bin\\gdb.exe

## Test

There is a `log_demo.pas` in the repository. Try to build this one and run it.

Tested on:
- Windows 7
- Ubuntu 18.04

## Documentation

The source code is the documentation. It is short and has a lot of comments.
If there are still questions, feel free to ask (nicely!).
